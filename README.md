# Assignment 1: RegEx Search and Replacement

Use attached mock_data file.

Each of the following tasks are independent / will be performed on newly opened "mock_data". Accidental changes to the header can be ignored.

Please supply the regex search + replace terms:

- to find all IP addresses (e.g., "46.60.226.75" should match)

- to find all E-Mail addresses (e.g., "a.ellis@bla.net" should match)

- to find all salaries

- to transform the column "Last Seen" from US to year-month-day date format while leaving the rest as is. (e.g., "08/23/2012" should be changed to "2012-08-23" while leaving everything else as is)

- to transform the column "SSN" from 9 digits to last four digits while leaving the rest as is. (e.g., "122725502" -> "5502")

- to strip everything BUT the email column.

- to convert all rows to "Last Name" [TAB] "First Name" [TAB] "Last Seen" only (strip the rest). The "Last Seen" column should be in year-month-day format. ([TAB]s will allow you to copy and paste it's result into excel.)

- to strip everything BUT "Number of Children" and "Number of Logins" AND reorder its entries to be "Number of Logins" [TAB] "Number of Children".  ([TAB]s will allow you to copy and paste it's result into excel.)
